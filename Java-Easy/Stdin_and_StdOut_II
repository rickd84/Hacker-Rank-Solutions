/*
 * In this challenge, you must read an integer, a double, and a String from stdin, then print the values according to the instructions in the Output Format 
 section below. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor.

Input Format

There are three lines of input:

    The first line contains an integer.
    The second line contains a double.
    The third line contains a String.

Output Format

There are three lines of output:

    On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
    On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
    On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.
