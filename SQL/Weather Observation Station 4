Weather Observation Station 4

Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
The STATION table is described as follows:

Field       Type
ID          NUMBER
CITY        VARCHAR(21)
STATE       VARCHAR(2)
LAT_N       NUMBER
LONG_W      NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

My Solution:
SELECT COUNT(CITY)- COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION ;
