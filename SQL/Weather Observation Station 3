Weather Observation Station 3

Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.
The STATION table is described as follows:

Field       Type
ID          NUMBER
CITY        VARCHAR(21)
STATE       VARCHAR(2)
LAT_N       NUMBER
LONG_W      NUMBER

My Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE MOD(ID , 2)=0;
